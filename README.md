# CL260-Tuning
Tuning parts and firmware settings for the CL260 3D-Printer.

The parts are for attaching the endstops.

## Firmware

Check out a fresh version of Marlin and copy the files from `firmware/` into the directory. 

You can also copy the appropriate settings by hand if you are unsure about changes in the format of Configuration.h

## Cura

Add the CL-260 in Cura, set the G-Code flavor to "Marlin" and copy the start.gcode and end.gcode to the appropriate text fields in cura. The G-Code should prime your extruder nicely.
